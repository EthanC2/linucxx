# linucxx - a C++ library for everyday linux programming
linucxx is a general-purpose library that I add to whenever I have a need in a project that is not provided by the C standard library nor its GNU extensions. 
Although the library is written in C++, it is written in a non-nonsense C-style that prioritizes being able to understand every line of code without additional context.
